        <h3>CSA Funding to Attend CCC 2026</h3>
        <p>
          The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) is pleased to offer grants to Canadian postsecondary students to attend the 2026 Canadian CubeSat Conference under their Announcement of Opportunity (AO) to support Canadian Student Participation in Space Conferences and Training Events. Successful applicants will be awarded a grant to cover their accommodations and meal allowances, registration fees, and travel expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be eligible for a grant under this AO, applicants must meet the following eligibility criteria:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident;</li>
          <li>be enrolled in a Canadian post-secondary institution at the college, undergraduate, master’s or doctoral levels at the time of the event.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Although not an eligibility requirement, priority may be given to students who have been selected by the organizing committee to give a presentation (oral or poster) during the event. Priority may also be given to applicants from underrepresented populations. The CSA therefore encourages applicants to indicate, on a voluntary basis, if they belong to one or more of the four following groups: women, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities and members of visible minorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instructions on how to submit an application can be found in <a href="https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/funding-programs/funding-opportunities/ao/2023-canadian-student-participation-in-space-conferences-and-training-events.asp#4" class="highlight-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section 4</a> of the AO.
